#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The files that will need to be edited or added are:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to create the logo image description.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can propose the exact changes. Once that file is added, I will provide the `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks for the metadata update and the new logo file.

A stylized symbol of a rising line chart with three bars of increasing height, set against a subtle globe-like background. The chart lines are in a gradient from deep blue at the bottom to bright green at the top. The background is a light gray with faint circular patterns. Below the chart, the words 'Crypto Market Summary' are written in a bold, modern sans-serif font in dark blue. The overall design is clean and minimal, suitable for a logo.
